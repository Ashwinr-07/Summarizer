S3 is inexpensive object storage in Amazon's cloud storage service.
It can't be tied just to your EC2 instance, like it currently is with EBS.
S3 can store photos, videos, log files and log files, but it can be accessed from anywhere.
For more information, visit EC2.com/EC2 and Amazon's EC2 console on how to use S3 in the AWS console.
The price of S3 starts at $99.99 for most of the storage services in the U.S.
